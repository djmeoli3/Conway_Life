# Conway_Life

## Description
This project simulates the automated population patterns of 'Conway's Game of Life'. The code uses a small list of rules that determine the regulation of population size, limiting both underpopulation and overpopulation. 

## Purpose
After recently taking a class in differential equations, I am fascinated by the concept of evolving populations and predator/prey relationships. Long term, I hope to learn how to model and map different types of data using code and machine learning applications. However, I decided to start small and jump into a beginner level project by replicating Conway's Game of Life. This was my first piece of Python code where users can provide interaction (declaring live cells before the simulation) in a separate window as opposed to just a terminal. By doing so, I learned how to utilize the library 'pygame' in this relatively small application. Additionally, after some research, I was able to utilize conditional statements to create a simple algorithm that follow the predetermined rules of the game that determine population behaviors.

## Future Work
- Creating preset live cell inputs that mimic some of the iconic Conway shapes and patterns
- Modifying the algorithm that represents the default rules for Conway's Game of Life
- Implement a more creative visual representation of the cells
